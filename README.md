## <u>Kaggle Competitions</u>:
### <b>[Fake News](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news)</b>
This competition involved creating a classifier to determine if the selected news article might be fake news. For this competition, I designed a simple LSTM neural network using Pytorch. My Kaggle kernel can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/awalber94/fake-news-prediction-using-lstm-neural-network), or on [Github](https://github.com/awalber/fake-news-detector).
